# Enchanted Mirror
**Enchanted Mirror** is being written to run on anything UWP apps can run on, although the original intent it to run on Windows IoT on a Rasberry Pi 2 (at least until an upgrade to a 3 is possible)

The intention is to be moduler, simple speech recognistion, person recognition and interactions with assistants such as Alexa and Google Home

### Speech control
The idea that there is a monitor of some description sat behind a two-way mirror doesn't appeal if it remains on at all time.

Therefore using the GPIO pins on a Rasberry PI, along with a relay and voice control, the plan is to use commands such as `go to sleep` to turn the screen off and `wake up` to turn the screen on.

Speech can also be used to:
* Display the detail behind a news headline
* Switch to a different news feed
* Display the detail of a sheduled item in the users diary
* Expand the diary view, i.e. `this week`, `this month` or `this afternoon`
* Switch radio stations
* Control the music player, such as next song, select play list etc.
